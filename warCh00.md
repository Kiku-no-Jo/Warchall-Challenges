### Level 0
Begin by making a password for ssh login.
Then paste this command or write it manually on your terminal:
> `ssh -p 19198 yourname@warchall.net`

Now that you are connected, you need to locate the level 0 folder by using this command:
> `$ cd /home/level/00_welcome/`

By using `ls` command you will see a README.md file which contains the solution.
Now use `cat` to view its content.

Congratulation! You passed the first level
